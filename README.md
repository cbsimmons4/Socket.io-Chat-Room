# Socket.io-Chat-Room

This is a basic web chat room application using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io. This was made following The Net Ninja tutorial on socket.io - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i4V-_ZVwLmOusj8YAUhj_9

Deployed using Heroku:
https://cam-chat-app.herokuapp.com/

Try opening the app up in multiple windows across one or more devices!

Update! I've made a slightly better chat app: https://github.com/cbsimmons4/React-Chat


*Note: It could take a minute to load the app the first time. It's deployed using Heroku's free tier plan, which causes the server to sleep when not in use.*
